# Akumajou Dracula (X68000) 15KHz Version
This is a hack that allows anyone to play Akumajou Dracula on 15KHz displays, tested with a real Sharp X68000 Compact. The full game is required to be able to run this hack.

# Installing
Download the release zip and rename DRA15k.X or DRA15kEZ.X to DRA.X. Then copy to the Akumajou Dracula Disk 1 floppy, overwriting the old DRA.X. Run the game by mounting both Akumajou Dracula floppy disks and starting your system. Also compatible running off SxSI hard drive images.

# Building from source
To build the source, you will need to download and build run68x for your platform of choice, and put it in the bin/ directory. Then type 'make' to build.

Disassembly generated from dis for X68000, then converted to UTF-8 for easy editing in modern text editors and IDEs.

Before assembling, the source file is converted back to Shift-JIS.
